      <p class="pb-6">As rumors and lies have killed in the past, there are also victims of misinformation on the media.
        Political parties are wrongfully attacked, individuals are being acussed of acts they never commited and people
        are even killed.</p>
        
      <p class="pb-6">Spreading rumors just because we agree with what we think or feel can have consequences,
        from influencing the result of elections, to leading to someone's death.</p>
